# Arch.System.SourceGenerator

I know, I know... writing queries is always sooo much work. If only you could have it all generated... wait... you can!

The `Arch.System.SourceGenerator` package provides some code generation utils. With them, queries can be written virtually by themselves which saves some boilerplate code.

**Query** methods can be generated **in** [**all classes**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] **as long as they are partial**. However it makes most sense in the [`BaseSystem`](arch.system.md). The attributes can be used to meaningfully describe what query to generate, and the query will always call the annotated method. And the best, they can even be called manually!

## Example

Let's take a look at the whole thing and what is possible with it.

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="lang-csharp">public partial class MovementSystem : BaseSystem&#x3C;World, <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-2">float</a>>{

    public MovementSystem(World world) : base(world) {}
    
    <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-3">[Query] </a>
    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
    public void MoveEntity(<a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-4">[Data]</a> ref float time, <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-5">ref Position pos, in Velocity vel</a>)
    {
        pos.X += time * vel.X;
        pos.Y += time * vel.Y;
    }
    
    [Query]
    <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-6">[All&#x3C;Player, Mob, Particle>, Any&#x3C;Moving, Idle>, None&#x3C;Alive>] </a>
    public void StopDeadEntities(ref Velocity vel)
    {
        vel.X = 0;
        vel.Y = 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

Again, there are attributes without generics that accept types. In addition, you can also pass an `entity` in the method signature of a `[Query]` to refer to the current entity. In addition to `ref`, you can also use `in` or `out` or omit the modifier altogether.
{% endhint %}

Looks simple, doesn't it? But perhaps also a little confusing because you don't yet know what exactly is happening here. Let me explain it to you.

Each method marked with `[Query]` is extended to a `Query` by the source generation and called once for each `Entity` that matches it. The method signature and additional annotations act as a filter. This means that the `MoveEntity` method from above is called for each `Entity` with `Position` and `Velocity`. We only write the method with which we process each `Entity` and what we need... and `Arch.System.SourceGenerator` takes care of the rest.&#x20;

A method with the same name and query is generated for each of these selected methods. This query method then calls our selected method for each `Entity`. E.g. `MoveEntity` which is getting called for each fitting `Entity` and `MoveEntityQuery`, the generated method that runs the query and calls `MoveEntity` for each `Entity`. This happens for every method within a class that has been marked with `Query`. So also for `StopDeadEntities`.&#x20;

In addition, if `BaseSystem.Update` has not been implemented itself, a `BaseSystem.Update` is generated which calls all `Queries` according to their sequence in the system. So all you have to do is call `BaseSystem.Update()` or the generated query directly.

```csharp
var world = World.Create();
var movementSystem = new MovementSystem(world);

myMovementSystem.Update(deltaTime);            // Calls both Querys in order automatically
myMovementSystem.MoveEntityQuery(world);       // Manually calling the querys
myMovementSystem.StopDeadEntitiesQuery(world);
```

It can be that easy, I bet that blew your mind, didn't it?

## Overriding Update



[^1]: Also static ones, without a `BaseSystem` inheritance.&#x20;

[^2]: A value that we pass into the system with `Update` and which we can access with `[Data]` in the query.

[^3]: Marks this method so that a query is generated from this method and its signature.

[^4]: Specifies that this value is entered into the query from outside in order to process it further here.

[^5]: The components of the individual entity that we access and edit.

[^6]: A filter so that we only process certain entities.
